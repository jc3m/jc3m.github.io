              <p><b>It started with a love for drawing</b>, then blossomed into an exploration of instruments.
                I learned the violin and participated in various youth orchestras where I developed a deeper
                interest in creating new things. Soon, I picked up Adobe Photoshop and began forming magnificent
                landscapes using only a computer. When I joined my first robotics team, I was given the opportunity
                 to tackle unique and interesting problems by building solutions.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p><b>By the time I was taught how to program</b>, I had a voracious appetite for developing
                 projects, discovering new techniques, and creating exciting applications. When I got to the
                 University of Illinois, I attended my first hackathon and immmediately fell in love with the
                 culture. Since then, building web applications have become my primary hobby and learning various
                 parts of the art fascinate me ever single day.
              </p>

              <br />
              <p><b>Currently, I study Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</b> My
                 interest in both computer hardware and computer programming led me to choose a field of study right
                  in between Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. The method behind how transistors can be organized
                  into a Finite State Machine, then programmed to become a functioning computer is one of the most
                  fascinating stories I have ever heard. While I do spend an extensive amount of time thinking about low
                  level programming, I spend a large portion of my time working with high level applications such as the
                  Hadoop framework to perform data analysis for my job. It was never something I thought abought doing but
                   the more I experience it, the more interesting the subject becomes.
              </p>

              <br />
              <p><b>While being a student provides consistently large amounts of work</b>, it's not the only thing I do.
                When I'm able to scrape a little bit of free time from school work and programming, I enjoy playing guitar,
                losing to my friends in Super Smash Brothers, and watching movies or shows.
